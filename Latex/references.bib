abstract = {Continuous catalytic naphtha reformers are one of the main refinery units producing hydrogen. Reliable and comprehensive modeling of such a complex and integrated refinery unit plays a pivotal role in optimization to increase the efficiency of the process. A reaction network with 26 pseudo components and 58 reactions, considering coke formation and catalyst activity, was proposed to predict the outlet compositions of reactors in more detail. The whole unit, including reaction and purification sections, was simulated to cover all products. NOMAD optimizer, with the mesh adaptive direct search algorithm, is used to minimize energy costs. Non-linear constraints were defined to guarantee the quality of the final products. The optimized decision variables reduced the energy cost by 13.5%, mainly caused by a significant decline in natural gas consumption. The simulation also indicated an increase of 4800 ton/y in reformate production, which the product is rich in aromatics. By contrast, LPG, hydrogen-rich gas, and coke production dropped by nearly 4355, 321, and 127 ton/y, respectively. The coke production decline can significantly increase the catalyst lifetime and decrease the operating cost of the catalyst regeneration unit.}
